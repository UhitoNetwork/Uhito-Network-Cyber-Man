# Public Wi‑Fi Risks

## What Happens
When you use free Wi‑Fi at cafes, airports, or hotels, others on the same network can sometimes see what you do – including passwords.

## How to Protect Yourself
1. **Avoid logging into bank or email** on public Wi‑Fi.
2. **Use a VPN** (Virtual Private Network) – it encrypts everything.
3. **Turn off file sharing** and "network discovery" in your device settings.
4. **Use your phone's hotspot** instead of public Wi‑Fi for sensitive tasks.

## What to Do
If you must use public Wi‑Fi, at least make sure websites have "https://" in the address (the padlock icon).

# Fake Tech Support Calls

## What Happens
Someone calls saying they're from Microsoft, Apple, or your internet company. They claim your computer has a virus and ask you to install software or pay for a fix. It's a scam.

## How to Protect Yourself
1. **Legit companies never call you out of the blue** about problems on your computer.
2. **Never give remote access** to someone who calls you.
3. **Never pay** by gift card, wire transfer, or crypto.

## What to Do
Hang up. If you're worried, call the company using the number on their official website (not the one the caller gave).

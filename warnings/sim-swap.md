# SIM Swap – They Steal Your Phone Number

## What Happens
A thief tricks your phone company into moving your number to a SIM card they control. They get all your SMS codes and can break into your bank, email, social media.

## How to Protect Yourself
1. **Call your phone company** and ask for a **PIN or password** on your account. No changes without it.
2. **Use an authentication app** (like Google Authenticator) instead of SMS for 2FA.
3. **If your phone suddenly loses signal** and you can't fix it, call your bank immediately.

## What to Do If It Happens
1. Contact your phone company to reclaim your number.
2. Call your bank and tell them your number was stolen.
3. Change passwords for all important accounts using a trusted device.

# Phishing by SMS – "Smishing"

## What Happens
You get a text that looks like it's from your bank, a delivery service, or a government agency. It says there's a problem and asks you to click a link.

## How to Spot It
- The sender number looks weird (often not a normal phone number).
- The message creates urgency: "Your account will be closed!"
- The link doesn't match the real website (e.g., "amaz0n-update.com").

## What to Do
**Never click the link.** Go directly to the official website or app. If it's about a delivery, check the tracking on the official site.

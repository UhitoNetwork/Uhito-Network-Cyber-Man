# The Bank Call

Ahmed got a call from "his bank." The caller said someone tried to use his card in another country. To stop it, they needed him to confirm his card number and the code sent by SMS.

Ahmed was worried. He gave the information.

Next day, his account was empty.

**The truth:** The caller was a scammer. Banks never ask for your full card number or SMS codes over the phone.

**What Ahmed should have done:**
- Hang up
- Call the bank using the number on the back of his card
- Never share SMS codes with anyone

**Remember:** Real banks don't call you to ask for secrets.

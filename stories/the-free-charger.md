# The Free Charger

Layla was at an airport, her phone nearly dead. She found a USB charging station – free and convenient. She plugged in.

What she didn't know: that USB port could transfer data as well as power. A bad actor had modified it to install malware on her phone.

Later, strange transactions appeared from her bank.

**How to stay safe:**
- Use your own charger and plug into a wall outlet.
- Carry a portable power bank.
- If you must use a public USB, use a "USB condom" (a data blocker) – a small adapter that only allows power.

**Remember:** Public USB ports can be dangerous. Charge from the wall.

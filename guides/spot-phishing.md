# How to Spot Phishing Messages

Phishing is when scammers send fake messages (email, text, social media) to steal your information.

## Red Flags

1. **Urgency** – "Your account will be closed in 24 hours!"
2. **Strange sender** – The email address doesn't match the company (e.g., "support@paypal-security.net").
3. **Generic greeting** – "Dear Customer" instead of your name.
4. **Suspicious links** – Hover over the link to see the real address.
5. **Attachments you didn't expect** – Never open them.
6. **Poor spelling and grammar** – Legit companies usually check their writing.

## What to Do
- **Don't click.** Don't reply.
- **Check the official website** by typing the address yourself.
- **Forward phishing emails** to the company's abuse address (e.g., reportphishing@apple.com).
- **Delete it.**

**When in doubt, ignore and verify through official channels.**

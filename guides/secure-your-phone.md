# Secure Your Phone

## Lock Screen
Use a strong PIN (not just 1234) or biometrics (fingerprint/face). This stops someone who picks up your phone.

## Set a SIM PIN
A SIM PIN locks your SIM card. If someone steals your phone, they can't use your number for SMS verification.

**How to set it:**
- Android: Settings > Security > SIM card lock.
- iPhone: Settings > Cellular > SIM PIN.

## App Permissions
Check which apps have access to your camera, microphone, location, and contacts. Revoke anything that doesn't make sense.

## Updates
Turn on automatic updates. They fix security holes.

## Find My Phone
Enable "Find My Device" (Android) or "Find My iPhone" so you can locate, lock, or erase your phone if lost.

## Backups
Back up your photos and data regularly to the cloud or a computer.

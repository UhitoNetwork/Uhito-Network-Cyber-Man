# WHAT CYBER-MAN DOES

## Simple Actions, Real Protection

### Daily Activities:
1. **Warns** about new scams in simple language
2. **Teaches** basic protection to family and community
3. **Translates** tech threats into understandable warnings
4. **Reports** crimes through proper channels
5. **Connects** people to certified help when needed

### Community Work:
- Creates one‑page safety guides
- Speaks at local meetings (with certification)
- Helps small businesses with basic protection
- Teaches elders about phone safety
- Warns neighbors about current threats

### What They Never Do:
- Give uncertified technical advice
- Access others' devices without permission
- Break laws to "help"
- Create fear instead of awareness

### Their Method:
See threat → Understand it → Explain simply → Help community protect

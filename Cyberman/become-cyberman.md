# BECOME A CYBER-MAN

## Your Path Starts Here

### First: Understand What Cyber-Man Is
1. Read [Who is Cyber-Man?](who-is-cyberman.md)
2. Understand this is about protection, not hacking
3. Accept that certification is required for public work

### The Path:

#### Step 1: Learn Basics (1-3 Months)
- Study cybersecurity fundamentals
- Get entry-level certification (Security+ or equivalent)
- Practice explaining threats simply

#### Step 2: Help Privately (Months 4-6)
- Protect your own household
- Help only family and close friends
- Never give public advice without certification

#### Step 3: Get Certified for Community Work (6+ Months)
- Advanced certifications for your focus area
- Liability insurance (check local laws)
- Official registration if required locally

#### Step 4: Protect Community (After Certification)
- Start small workshops
- Create simple awareness materials
- Build community trust slowly

### Important:
- **No shortcuts** – Certification is non-negotiable
- **Start small** – Family first, then community
- **Stay legal** – Always follow laws
- **Keep learning** – Threats change, so must you

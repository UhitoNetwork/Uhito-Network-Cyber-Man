# 5 Things You Can Do Today to Stay Safe Online

1. **Turn on two‑factor authentication (2FA)**  
   Most accounts let you add a second step – usually a code sent to your phone. This stops most hackers even if they steal your password.

2. **Use a different password for every account**  
   If one account gets hacked, the others stay safe. A password manager helps you remember them all.

3. **Check links before you click**  
   Hover over a link with your mouse (or press and hold on phone) to see the real web address. If it looks strange, don't click.

4. **Update your phone and computer**  
   Updates fix security holes. Set them to automatic so you never forget.

5. **Backup your important files**  
   Copy photos and documents to an external drive or cloud storage. If ransomware hits, you won't lose everything.

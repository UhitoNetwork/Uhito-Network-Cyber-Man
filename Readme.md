# Uhito Network Awareness Repository
## Simple Words. Real Protection.

Most security advice uses complicated tech words that normal people don't understand. They hear "phishing," "malware," "ransomware" – and they tune out. They don't know what to do, so they do nothing.

**This repo is different.**

Every file here is written in plain, simple language. No jargon. No technical depth. Just clear warnings and easy steps anyone can follow.

### Our Philosophy

- Hackers use simple tricks. We use simple warnings.
- If you can't explain it in one minute, it's too complicated.
- Awareness should feel like a friend warning you, not a lecture.
- The **Cyber-Man** is anyone who learns properly and helps others – you can be one too.

# Uhito Network Awareness Program

## What We Do
We create simple, non‑technical warnings and guides to help ordinary people protect themselves online. Our materials are free for anyone to use.

## Why We Do It
- Too many people lose money and data because they never got a simple warning.
- Most security advice is written for experts, not for regular people.
- We believe that if you can explain it simply, anyone can stay safe.

## Our Approach
1. **Observe** – Watch for new scams and threats.
2. **Simplify** – Translate technical threats into everyday language.
3. **Share** – Distribute through volunteers, social media, and community workshops.
4. **Empower** – Encourage people to become Cyber-Men themselves.

## Who We Are
We are a group of certified cybersecurity learners who chose to use our knowledge for community protection. We are not hackers, not government agents – just people who want to help.
